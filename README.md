# InfiniteTravel

InfiniteTravel is a 2D side-scrolling platformer built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. You take control of a hero navigating an endless terrain filled with enemies, bosses, and increasing difficulty. With dynamic background scrolling, a responsive combat system, and a fully integrated HUD, InfiniteTravel aims to deliver an immersive arcade-style experience in the browser.
